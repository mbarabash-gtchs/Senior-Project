Note: all coding was done within jupyter. I have uploaded the source code for my layers of the neural network. 

Also please note: "model" refers to the appended layers themselves. "Full model" refers to both the appended layers as well as the code that trains the model.

## Variants of Network:

#### Version 1
Version 1 had a problem; the full model would begin training, but would then the loss, as shown below, would jump around and stagnate.

This version was atrocious. Not only did the full model not learn, but it was not even able to overfit a small dataset, meaning that something fundemental was wrong. I built several variants of the full model, and each seemed to provide small improvements. I started shuffling the order that pictures were presented to the model, resulting in a nicer looking loss decrease. The loss would still eventually stop decreasing at an alarmingly large number, so I decided to see if there was something wrong with my dataset instead. It turned out that my dataset, while creating variance, did not correctly change the labels of each corresponding picture. After I resolved that problem, version 1 was able to overfit a dataset of 9 pictures, shown below. This was still far from a satisfactory result however; learning 9 images is nothing.

#### Version 2
Version 2 seemed to be an improvment to Version 1 at first; it was able to overfit small datasets much quicker than Version 1. However, Version 2 was still unable to overfit larger datasets.
#### Version 3
Version 3's full model results were practically not much better, if not worse, than the version 2 full model. It is difficult to judge because both version 2 and version 3 were unable to reach a satisfactory fit accuracy. 
The changes performed were to the appended model. In version 3, the size of each layer was slightly different, although the total amount of layers remained the same. The following graph shows the trend that both version 2 and 3 tended to follow while training larger datasets.

#### Version 4
Version 4 made no changes to appended layers; the only changes were to the full model. Version 4 utilized version 2's appended layers, and simply changed the way that training occured. The significant difference was the introduction of normalization. Every input would be normalized prior to being evaluated by the network, which allows the network to work better. Normalization was done by taking the average of all inputs and then dividing by the standard deviation.
