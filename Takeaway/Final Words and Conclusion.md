This project took a lot of time to complete. I ended up running into many unexpected problems (which ironically was expected), but I was able to learn a lot because of them. Throughout the entire coding process, I ran into obstacles as trivial as syntax and a lack of knowledge, and as complex as why a network was unable to produce results on a validation set. None of these problems were easy to complete; they may have had simple solutions, but I would often spend more time on problems with simple solutions than on problems that were more complicated. Despite the fact that I was unable to reach my ideal goal, a neural network that achieves human levels of accuracy, I am still proud of my product. Most high schoolers have no idea what a neural network is, much less how it functions and how to build one. Part of my product is also the dataset generator. I initially had no plan to generate a dataset, but there are many upsides to this. For one, I gained experience in 3D modeling, but more importantly I now try to see if a problem can be solved programmatically prior to attempting to solve it by hand. 
Overall, I am glad to have completed this project. It is difficult to emphasize how much I actually learned while in various stages of my project, as a lot of what I learned is difficult to express in words. However, this project would have been worthwhile even if I were to not learn half as much as I did. The experiences I went through while doing this project are something that are worth experiencing for themselves, even if you do not learn anything. Perhaps most importantly for me is that I plan to work with neural networks even after graduation.
