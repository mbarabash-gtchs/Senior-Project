I have uploaded several Jupyter notebooks, each containing different variants of my appended layers as well as showing some of their results. To open a notebook, it should only be necessary to click on it within a browser. If a notebook fails to load, then that may be due to its large size. The two notebooks "Train.ipynb" and "Read Dataset.ipynb" are simplified variants of "fromSqueezeNet-v8p2" and "fromSqueezeNet-v7p1" respectively.
