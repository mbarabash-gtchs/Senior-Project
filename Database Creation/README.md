This folder contains two files with code: dog_basic and dog_complex. "dog_complex" was the file I used to create my final product. "dog_basic" is a file that I created for my portfolio that contains an extremely simplified version of dog_complex in which I added comments to that explain what portions of code are doing. 

Here is what blender looks like when working within it:

To briefly explain blender; the left side of the screen allows for python inputs and scripts to be written, while the right side is where traditional 3D modeling occurs. The reason that blender is convenient unlike most 3D modeling software is because these two sections are very well integrated with each other. When an action is performed in box B, a line of code that would reproduce that action is displayed in box E. That information can be plugged into either box A or box D in order to either write a script to be executed later or cause an immediate response (respectively). If an action that interacts with specific models is required, box C can be used to find the names of those models as well as perform transformations that are shown in box E.
