I have uploaded two notebooks within each file which contain code that can be looked at to see what I have done. The complex variant of each notebook which contains  of I have also included the final weights of my network, so if someone wishes to run my network and use my weights instead of training from scratch, then they could use those. 

I have uploaded several Jupyter notebooks, each containing different variants of my appended layers as well as showing some of their results. To open a notebook, it should only be necessary to click on it within a browser. If a notebook fails to load, then that may be due to its large size. The two notebooks "Train.ipynb" and "Read Dataset.ipynb" are simplified variants of "fromSqueezeNet-v8p2" and "fromSqueezeNet-v7p1" respectively.
