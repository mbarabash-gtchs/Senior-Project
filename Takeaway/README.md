Although I believe that the information I recorded on which layers worked better for training and validation is more suited to be a final product, I have nonetheless uploaded the actual "notebooks" which contain code that can be looked at to see what I have done in a straightforward manner. 

I have uploaded several Jupyter notebooks, each containing different variants of my appended layers as well as showing some of their results. To open a notebook, it should only be necessary to click on it within a browser. If a notebook fails to load, then that may be due to its large size. The two notebooks "Train.ipynb" and "Read Dataset.ipynb" are simplified variants of "fromSqueezeNet-v8p2" and "fromSqueezeNet-v7p1," respectively. 

I have also included the final weights generated for my network during training, so that anyone that wishes to continue training layers beginning with my weights instead of from scratch, then it would be possible.
